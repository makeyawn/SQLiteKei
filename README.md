##Project Structure
- **SQLiteKei** - The main project which represents the UI and business layer.
- **SQLiteKei.DataAccess** - Provides functionality to access an sqlite database and to create SQL queries using custom QueryBuilders

###Test Projects
- **SQLiteKei.UnitTests** - The unit tests for the main project.
- **SQLiteKei.DataAccess.UnitTests** - The unit tests for the DataAccess project.
- **SQLiteKei.IntegrationTests** - The main project for integration tests of all projects. Note: tests need the NUnit 3 Runner to be started from VS locally. R# does not support the [OneTimeSetup] and [OneTimeTearDown] features of NUnit which replaced [TestFixtureSetup] and [TestFixtureTearDown] respectively.

##Trivia
- About the project name: I was looking for a working title and noticed that all the cool stuff like Manager, Management, Studio, Administrator, etcetera all were in use already. Since I like to use random Japanese words as working titles for my projects I picked the Japanese Kanji ç³» (written as 'kei') which means "system" or "lineage".
- It started out as a side project for me to learn different technologies. Hooray for messy beginner code! This tool has **not** started out using the MVVM pattern, though I started using it midway-through and refactored it towards this as much as possible.
- I organized myself using [Taiga.io](https://taiga.io "Taiga.io"), an open source project management tool that supports Scrum and Kanban styled procedures. It's a really neat and powerful tool, you should check them out.
